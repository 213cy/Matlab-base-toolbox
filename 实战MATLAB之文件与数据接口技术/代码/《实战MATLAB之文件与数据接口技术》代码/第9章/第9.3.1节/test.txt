MATLAB is a high-level technical computing language and interactive 
environment for algorithm development, data visualization, data analysis, 
and numeric computation. Using the MATLAB product, you can solve technical 
computing problems faster than with traditional programming languages, 
such as C, C++, and Fortran.

You can use MATLAB in a wide range of applications, including signal and 
image processing, communications, control design, test and measurement, 
financial modeling and analysis, and computational biology. Add-on 
toolboxes (collections of special-purpose MATLAB functions, available 
separately) extend the MATLAB environment to solve particular classes of 
problems in these application areas.

MATLAB provides a number of features for documenting and sharing your work. 
You can integrate your MATLAB code with other languages and applications, 
and distribute your MATLAB algorithms and applications. Features include:
    * High-level language for technical computing
    * Development environment for managing code, files, and data
    * Interactive tools for iterative exploration, design, and problem 
solving
    * Mathematical functions for linear algebra, statistics, Fourier 
analysis, filtering, optimization, and numerical integration
    * 2-D and 3-D graphics functions for visualizing data
    * Tools for building custom graphical user interfaces
    * Functions for integrating MATLAB based algorithms with external 
applications and languages, such as C, C++, Fortran, Java?, COM, and 
Microsoft Excel.
